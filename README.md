# Esper Zukki - The Paranormal Detective

Website with a fictional concept created to practice my web development, design skills and to promote the work of Zukki as an actress and idol - NO commercial use intended. The concept is about a psychic detective that uses her powers to fight crime involving paranormal activities.
See final result: [Esper Zukki](https://ciel-almeida.github.io/esper-zukki/)

## 2. Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- Form Submit (Service to Send Emails)

## 3. Best practices

For this project I used the css classes naming convention **B.E.M** witch consist of Block, Element and Modification.
I also tried my best to maintain the css code the most small possible using the principles of **DRY**. Besides that, the site is **totally responsive** and made with the concept of **mobile first** which in my opinion is the most efficient way of build a website.

## 4. What I have learned and what could have been done better

In this project I used figma to come with an inicial concept for the site and it was of great help. Besides of that I used the Form Submit wich was of great help to make the form work even on Github Pages.

For my next projects I want to make something more sophisticated and invest more in UI Design, for me that was something that coul have been better.
